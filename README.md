# Multithreaded Data Processing Application

## Overview

This C/C++ application is designed to efficiently process data concurrently using multithreading. It simulates data input from multiple sources and demonstrates proper synchronization mechanisms for data integrity. The code aims to meet the requirements of a real-time data processing task.

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Windows operating system (for the provided example using Windows API)

## Building and Running the Code

To compile the code, use a C/C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later:

```bash
g++ -o your_executable your_file.cpp -pthread
